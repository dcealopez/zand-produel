Thanks to:
ZDoom Wiki for supplying decorate documentation. My Clan, CombineBob, Catastrophe,
HumanBones and Radnsmash for taking the time and test out my constant updates.
iD for making the weapons terribly unbalanced and inferior to the Super Shotgun. 
QuakeLive for having CA which is fun as hell and inspired me to make TLMS fun 
in Doom.

And you for downloading.
